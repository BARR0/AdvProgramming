A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

For 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode code.
For n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all one's, the n+1 bit is 0, followed by n-1 bytes with most significant 2 bits being 10.
This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

   Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
      (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)
   --------------------+---------------------------------------------
   0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx
   0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0000 0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a valid utf-8 encoding.

Note:
The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

Example 1:

data = [197, 130, 1], which represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.

Return true.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
Example 2:

data = [235, 140, 4], which represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.

Return false.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.

Solution:

To properly check all cases, the program is divided into a check for a single character of variable size and 
another loop that goes through each individual character. When checking an individual character, first, 
we get the size from the first byte passed by checking the first few bits. If there only the first bit is one, 
we return false since the character doesn’t start correctly. If the size is greater than one, we check that 
the specified quantity of bytes start correctly. Of any of these conditions isn’t met, we return false.

When a valid character is found, we go forwards in the data the needed number of bytes and check the 
next one. If the end of the data is reached, we return true.

The running time is O(n) since each byte is checked only once.
