Solution:

The game requires that you use the pod’s resources to get to the goal as fast as
possible. These resources are the direction you’re moving, thrust, boost, and the
opponents position. The first step was to move properly to the next destination.
Second, I had to ensure the full thrust was being used and after harder turns were
introduced, the ship was made to stop and turn first and accelerate afterwards.
    The boost was a little different. I checked when the destination was in a
straight path so the boost would be beneficial. Finally, the opponent was added
and the use of the boost changed to being used as a way of getting away from it.
